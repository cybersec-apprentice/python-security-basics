# python-security-basics
Beginner Python projects focused on cybersecurity fundamentals

## Project 1: Password Strength Checker
A simple Python script that evaluates password strength based on basic security rules.
### Concepts covered
- User input
- Conditional logic
- Functions
### Features
- Minimum 10 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one special character
- At least one number
- No spaces allowed
- Allows multiple password inputs in a loop until the user types 'quit'
## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/cybersec-apprentice/python-security-basics.git
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd python-security-basics
3. Run the script using Python 3: python password_checker.py
4. Enter a password when prompted.
## Enhancements
Future improvements could include:
- Color-coded output for strong vs weak passwords
- Provide suggestions for improving passwords rather than only indicating failure
- Log password checks to a file for testing or analysis
- Create a GUI version using Tkinter or similar for a user-friendly interface
## Lessons Learned
- Learned how to separate logic (functions) from input/output
- Learned to use boolean flags to track password rules
- Learned how to provide clear and actionable feedback to users
